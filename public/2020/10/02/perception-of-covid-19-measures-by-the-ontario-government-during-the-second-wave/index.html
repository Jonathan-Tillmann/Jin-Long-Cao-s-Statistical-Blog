<h2>Executive summary</h2>
<p>Petit Poll was asked by the Conservative Party of Ontario to survey the Ontario public in regards to the current COVID-19 pandemic to better understand whether people are likely to vote for the Party in the upcoming general election. We conducted a mock survey based on simulated respondent parameters to give a cursory look into the broader trends in public health awareness regarding COVID-19. In summary, we find that government strategy should be to . Since our survey included questions relying on respondents to report their personal habits and knowledge regarding COVID-19, we believe these responses could be embellished to view the respondent in a more favourable light. The survey also underrepresents the younger voters of Ontario and has a majority response from Conservative voters and those greatly impacted by COVID-19 policies. Future studies should target the young voters and of particular concern are their social media habits. These studies would enable our employer to target them with information on party policies to positively impact their view of the Conservative Party.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-i.-introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Part I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most significant challenges that Ontarians are facing. However, many citizens remain uncertain or misinformed about the measures necessary to contain this public health crisis. In order to guide public health policy, maximize positive outcomes, and improve public trust in the Conservative Party of Ontario, the party requires insight into the trends that surround awareness of COVID. To this end, we conducted a large-scale phone survey to poll Ontarians on their personal habits regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was designed to extract information regarding the adherence of Ontario residents to current COVID-19 containment policies. Our findings show that the younger voting population lags behind in awareness of best practices around COVID.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-ii.-survey-methodology" class="section level2">
<h2>Part II. Survey methodology</h2>
<p>The population of interest for this survey are all people of voting age residing in Ontario and the population frame are all residential households within the province of Ontario. Our survey was delivered via telephone. We sampled all publicly available residential phone numbers ending in the digit ‘5’. This is a form of simple systematic sampling that provides a structured way to gather a large number of samples from the population frame while being representative of the true population.
A typical issue with simple systematic sampling is the existence of periodic patterns in the sample which may cause our sample to be unrepresentative of the true population. This is resolved through our survey methodology as each residential phone number is assumed to be independent of any others and therefore sampled points should be evenly distributed throughout the population (Changbao and Thomspon, 2020).
In the end we received a response from roughly Y% of households surveyed which resulted in roughly 1 500 data points.
The survey cost roughly $60 000 to provide based on the average of $40 per response for the average phone survey (Mie Yun-Lee, 2002). We required respondents to answer all questions of the survey and any respondents who failed to answer all questions were removed from the sample. Significant non-response biases were also resolved through postsurvey methods that reweighted responses from subpopulations with higher non-response rates. To protect the privacy of the respondent, they were simply assigned an ID number and minimal identifying information.</p>

<p>The questions found in the survey can be found in the appendix below.

<h2>Part IV. Simulated Survey Results</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this report, our dataset was simulated through some assumptions made about the population frame. For example, age demographics were sourced from Statistics Canada and adjusted for non-response bias to provide an accurate representation of the potential survey respondents.</p>
</div>
<div id="iv.a-demographic-data" class="section level1">
<h1>IV.a Demographic Data</h1>
<p><img src="/post/Perception-of-Covid-19-Measures-by-The-Ontario-Government-During-the-Second-Wave_files/figure-html/age_graph-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><img src="/post/Perception-of-Covid-19-Measures-by-The-Ontario-Government-During-the-Second-Wave_files/figure-html/vulnerable_graph-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>For the purposes of this question, participants were told that vulnerable groups included (but were not limited to) those over the age of 60, obese individuals, and those with pre-existing health conditions like respiratory infections, any type of cancer, and neurological conditions like dementia (Government of Canada, 2020).</p>
<p><img src="/post/Perception-of-Covid-19-Measures-by-The-Ontario-Government-During-the-Second-Wave_files/figure-html/living_graph-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>For the purposes of this question, COVID hotspots included Toronto (excluding the Greater Toronto Area), Ottawa, Windsor-Essex, and Peel region. These regions have been identified as consistently having a higher count of new cases as compared to the rest of Ontario (Mae Jones, 2020).</p>
<p><img src="/post/Perception-of-Covid-19-Measures-by-The-Ontario-Government-During-the-Second-Wave_files/figure-html/political_graph-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Looking at our demographic data, we see that the majority of respondents were in the 35-44 category with the distribution of respondent ages skewing older (Figure 1.1). We also find that a large majority (79.5%) of those polled lived in COVID hotspot regions (Figure 1.2). Furthermore, around 20.5% of those surveyed also considered themselves a member of a COVID vulnerable population (Figure 1.3). In Figure 1.4 we can also see that the majority of respondents to the survey considered themselves to be affiliated with the Conservative Party already.</p>

<h1>IV.b Respondent Information and Trust in COVID-19 Resources</h1>

<p><img src="/post/Perception-of-Covid-19-Measures-by-The-Ontario-Government-During-the-Second-Wave_files/figure-html/trustworthy_source-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We polled respondents on how they gather information about COVID-19 and their attitudes and trust towards different media sources. In Figure 2.1 above, we find that the majority of people get their news from social media and television. In Figure 2.2. we find however that the most trusted sources of news are television news and newspapers.</p>
<p><img src="/post/Perception-of-Covid-19-Measures-by-The-Ontario-Government-During-the-Second-Wave_files/figure-html/personal_confidence-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>For this question, respondents were asked to self-report their knowledgeability of COVID-19 information. 1 was considered to be least knowledgeable and 5 was considered most knowledgeable.</p>

<p>Figures 2.3 and 2.4 polled respondents on their views towards the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party and Doug Ford in relation to handling COVID-19. In both cases, a majority of respondents had trust in the party’s leadership during the pandemic.</p>

<h1>IV.c. Respondent Habits During COVID-19</h1>
<p><img src="/post/Perception-of-Covid-19-Measures-by-The-Ontario-Government-During-the-Second-Wave_files/figure-html/mask-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>For this purposes of this question, respondents were polled on how often they wear a mask when outdoors, in public, where social distancing is not possible.</p>
<p><img src="/post/Perception-of-Covid-19-Measures-by-The-Ontario-Government-During-the-Second-Wave_files/figure-html/social_bubble-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>For the purposes of this question, a social bubble/circle is defined as a group of no more than 10 people (including household members) who can interact with each other without following social distancing protocols (Ministry of Health Ontario, 2020).</p>

</div>
<div id="part-vi.-weaknesses-and-next-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Part VI. Weaknesses and Next Steps</h2>
<p>One major weakness of our survey is the potential for self-reporting bias. Respondents are more likely to offer responses that they view would portray them in a better light. A specific question that may have inflated responses is how respondents view their own knowledge on COVID-19.</p>
<p>Conducting our survey through residential phones may also have introduced non-response bias in which the younger age brackets were not accurately represented. Individuals belonging to the younger age brackets are more likely to reside in households such that elders respond to their landline or live alone without a landline.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as this poll is being conducted on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, we are much more likely to receive responses from those who are affiliated with the party. This may further skew our survey results to include data points from those typically associated with the voter demographics.</p>
<p>Additionally, the subject matter of the survey may lead to a response bias towards those who are directly affected by COVID-19, either being a member of or close to a member of a vulnerable population. These results gathered from this subset of the population are likely to show they are informed of COVID-19 and the best practices surrounding it.</p>
<p>Future studies conducted based on our simulated data should be concentrated on the younger age bracket respondents. Specifically, more insight into the types of social media used by the younger age brackets would provide the Conservative Party of Ontario avenues to target the demographic with policy information not limited to COVID-19. A follow up survey could also have Ontarians aged 18-34 as the sampling frame and ask questions regarding the specific social media platforms they use and the average time spent browsing each in a day.</p>
